            such as customer information, orders, products, and payments. The classicmodels database consists of the following tables:

              <p>To streamline the process of setting up the classicmodels database, we use a SQL script 
                that defines the schema and automatically creates the required tables. By running this script, 
                you can establish a fully structured database environment with all necessary relationships 
                between tables. use the below button to get script for the database schema and tables creation</p><br>

                                      being equal to the product line, we will display all the columns just for example

                                            since there is pultiple product purchaes, we are going toi see duplicates, we have classic

                                            product line one and product line two, just to see which product lines are purchased together

                  <p>In order to better understand the relationship between customer credit limits and sales performance, 
                    this report provides a breakdown of sales, grouped by customer credit limits. The goal is to determine
                     whether customers with higher credit limits tend to generate more sales, 
                    as one would expect, since a higher credit limit typically indicates greater purchasing power</p><br>

                                            customer number will bring the credit limit and we will sum the sales value, we create a CTE to do this,
                                            and name it sales, and we will bring back order number, customer number, credit limit which we will 
                                            group as well, we need to get sales value and then sum of sales value and name it sales value and
                                            we are querying from the sales table and we need to groupby our first three non aggregate columns

                                                  less than 75000, we will label a letter first, so that they areb in order meaning a less tahn 75k
                                                  we will only do four groupings, and we ill add another incase we made a mistake, so 
                                                  when credit limit is between 75000 and 100000 then b:75k - 100k

                              <h3>Product Breakdown By Sales Value</h3>
                              <p>we need the product breakdown cause we want to calculate the sales value, before we join the customers t
                                table, we will multiply quantity ordered by priceeach to get the sales value and we will name it sales
                                value, and rather than bringing back everything, lets just bring back the order number added after 
                                select, we want the order date, and the customer number, so we need to specify t1 order number as it is
                                ambigious and the sales value, we will also want to bring product code so it is broken down by product so
                                it can work out the sales value, then we can take a sum of that, but we have to create a query with
                                the table to do that, we want to sum so that we have one order number sales value of the
                                first four orders, lets use sub query to do this, put the query inside a bracket and name
                                it, we want everything except product code, so we bring order number, order date, customer
                                number and the sum of the sales value and we will name it sales value, we will then group it by our 
                                first three columns after our main sub query and we group by the three columns and this
                                gives us only one row for each order number

                                    <p> we can make the output a table again, we will use a CTE this time, it will be a sub query inside a 
                                      CTE, we can then join the  CTE to the customer table to get the customer details, with main CTE as open brackets
                                      and then close the brackets after, we can select star from main CTE, to get same output</p>

                                          <h3>Using a CTE in Place of Subquery for the above with Customer Name</h3>
                                          <p>now we can join customers and we will join that on t1.customer number equals t2.customer number,
                                            lets bring back ecrything usingwhich gives us the customer detsails and all their orders, but we only have one order per order number
                                            becaiuse we have aggregated the value of that sale, we will just bring the customer name back, from
                                            the customers table as we dont need anything else, rather than bringing all from both tables, we just 
                                            put one t1.all and it will bring everything from the main CTE and customer name from customer table
                                            and you see thsat the first customer has made three orders, and by using row number, we can order these
                                            sales by order date, we will also need to use lag or lead to get the value of their previous or next purchase
                                            
                                            </p>

                <p>we want to create a view and use that view to connect to power bi and start working the dashboard
                  a view is a presaved query that you can run at anytime. open up a new script to write the view, but
                  query we wnat to use for the dashboard will have sales, value and cost of sales, add a product and customer level
                  to show the office, country and evrything we can visualise in power bi, to do that we need to join 
                  all the tables together, i will bring everything back from the orders table and i will name it ord
                  or i will join order details or date and we will join that on order number = order number, and we will
                  bring customers table, and we will remember the order table has the customer number and we will aslo bring products table
                  and we will join that on order details dot product code = product.product code, lets bring in the employes in the 
                  offices, we cant bring in the office withpout bringing in the employess table, we join that on our
                  sales rep employee number from our customers table, and then bring in our office as we say office
                  code = o.office code</p><br>
